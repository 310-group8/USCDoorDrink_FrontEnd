# USCDoorDrink_FrontEnd

0. Environment: 
   This application is built and tested with Android API Level 32, on emulator Nexus 5X in 
   Android Studio 2021.1.1 Patch 1. We Strongly recommend to run this application under the same 
   environment for best performance.

1. Before launching the app:
   This app only shows the stores that are not farther than 2 miles away from the device's location.
   We already prepared 3 test stores for you near USC. You can change your emulator's location to a 
   place near USC to see them. The app also works in other places, but you will have to add stores 
   by yourself. The stores can be added when registering as a user.
   
2. Launching the app:
   Please give permission of precise location when prompted by the app.

3. Map
   a. A Map will be displayed once the app is launched. You can click on the floating button on 
   bottom left of the screen to access more functionalities (eg: login, view cart, view order,
   manage order, see recommendations, see profile), but most of them will need logging in!
   b. Store around you will appear as markers on the map. Markers might take a few seconds to load. 
   You can tap on them to see the route and the time needed for the deliveryman to reach your place.
   You can switch the mode of transportation, 
   
   BUT DO NOTE that if you want to show bicycling, please tap the right TIP of the bicycling chip.
   
   c. If you do not want to order at the current store, you can tap another marker or tap the floating 
   button on the bottom left. If you do want to order at the current store, click "Order at this 
   store". This requires login as well.
   
4. Login/Register

   with a cell phone icon to login.
